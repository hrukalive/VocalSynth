# VowelSynth
This is a simple java implementation of sine model. The program does not synthesize stochastic part and focus on the relationship between formant and timbre.

Recording Module does not calculate the formant and requires user to identify the position of the formant.

Blending is a feature for exploring the transition between two vowels.
